# video_frame_slicer

While watching a movie, did you ever felt the need to stop and take screen shot of that beautiful destination or the perfect shades (Yes, I do this :P) ? Well, most of the times, the screenshot get messed up or better yet, you don't want to stop the flow of a movie (stopping is not posssible while watching in a theater)<br>

Here's a solution, just feed in your video in the above notebook code and you will get all the frames in the video, hopefully in a very brief amount of time. So, there you go, now no need to go back 10sec and take that screenshot, just run the code and find the perfect shot :)<br>

<br>

Modifications to work on: <br>
- Improve the code to take time durations as input, so as to, just get frames for that time duration.
- Make a GUI for the above task and possibly to make a trackbar sort of GUI (Just like when you trim a video in a video player)
- Use these images(each frame form the video) along with bounding box cordinates of objects(detected via some algorithm) to train a neural network

Just check out the python notebook if you're a Reddit or 9gag fan :D
